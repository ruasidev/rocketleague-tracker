# using the code
run the script and it will prompt you to enter an EPIC Username. Enter the username there and it will return the ranks for that user
if the user was not found the script will stop and you will recieve an error message
please note that the username has to be exactly right (although not case-sensitive) as the script does not auto-fill usernames to the nearest result

feel free to use this code for whatever is needed
